# Development Paused, Discord Theme and Spotify Theme inspired by Material Design Coming Soon

#### *Important:*

This theme would have had to overwrite a lot of the colors set by spicetify, so instead I opted to make the theme with the replace_colors config off. If you install this and your spotify is completely black then you didn't read the installation instructions all the way.

**Also Remember To Play A Song Every Fresh Boot of Spotify In Order to Fully Load The Theme.**

* If for some reason this fails, just re-install

### Change Background

* Go to `background-image: url` 
* In the parenthesis between the apostraphes Insert the link and run `spictify update backup apply`
