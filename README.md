#### *Important:*

This theme would have had to overwrite a lot of the colors set by spicetify, so instead I opted to make the theme with the replace_colors config off. If you install this and your spotify is completely black then you didn't read the installation instructions all the way.

**Also Remember To Play A Song Every Fresh Boot of Spotify In Order to Fully Load The Theme.**

### Installation

Props to u/ongoodvxbes for this

* Use [this guide](https://rainmeter.simplecyber.ml/docs/spicetify) to install Spicetify (thanks [u/BenjaminBE4](https://reddit.com/u/BenjaminBE4))

* If you followed the guide correctly, you should now have 2 folders at `C:/Users/%USERNAME%/` (`.spicetify` & `spicetify-cli`)

* Download [Frostify](https://github.com/PlasmusAng/Frostify/releases)

* Unzip then change `Frostify-Master` to `Frostify`

* Copy `Frostify` folder to `C:/Users/%USERNAME%/.spicetify/Themes`

* <kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> then type `Powershell`

* Run `spicetify config replace_colors 0 current_theme Frostify`

* Run `Spicetify backup apply`

* Open the config file `C:/Users/%USERNAME%/.spicetify/config`

**Also Remember To Play A Song Every Fresh Boot of Spotify In Order to Fully Load The Theme.**

**If you edit the css make sure to run Spicetify Update Apply to both build the css and apply**

### Updating

To update:

* Open a terminal in the folder location and then just `git pull`
* Then Run Spicetify Update Apply
* If for some reason this fails, just re-install

### Change Background
If you have a file you want to use upload it to imgur and make sure the link you use is to the file(has a .jpg or .png at the end of the link)
Go to **background-image: url** and in the parenthesis between the apostraphes insert the link and run **spictify update backup apply**

### Bugs & Issues

I know there are a ton of bugs and I am actively working on fixing them. With that being said, please don't spam this repo with issues, as I know they exist. Please only post issues that make the app unusable, that way I can prioritize those.
I just recently modularized my code using stylus which will make it easier to maintain in the long run and make it easier to fix bugs and add features. Expect plenty of updates.

*Fork Primary Bugs:* 
Downloads widget not colored with the theme
Connected Devices below other text and not themed

### Communication

I am fairly often scouring the [Spectrum group for Spicetify-cli](https://spectrum.chat/spicetify?tab=posts) and that is the best place to reach me for now.
